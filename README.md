# NishasCreativeResume

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.1.

## Description
This is a work-in-progress project - till I am satisfied with my understanding of Inputs, Outputs, Directives, Routing and Events.   

I have divided my creative-resume project into following sections-   

data folder has the most important file of all cv-data.ts - the file that contains all the data to fill the different sections of the resume. This file contains cvData which is an array structure.   

cv - main component that holds all the other components  
header - contains Name, title, contact details   
education - displays education    
experience - displays experience   
references - an interactive element - when you click on the reference it will show the actual testimonial    
skills - linked to the references    
footer - social media links, download CV link    

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
